# Step 4: setting your environment variables


## Set your .env variables:

```txt
# your mongodb uri: in production, you'll switch this out to the URL provided by your service
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/list-project
# generate a JWT_KEY: https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm
JWT_KEY=hu0SnUlQBnp2C76jOUpldZfYudYjzBmRAtPLF452Iv0H8n3LaCnYUYXEHYxSKKF
# your email and password for your mailing service, highly recommend using another email to protect your accounts!
MAILER_EMAIL=your.email@gmail.com 
MAILER_PASSWORD=yourEmailPassword
MAILER_SERVICE=Gmail
MAILER_ADDRESS="Joey L <your.email@gmail.com>
```

Right now since we are in development, we have not properly filled out these environment variables, however, you will need to fill these in the with correct information in order for this to work. 

Correctly filling in these variables means:


* MONGODB_URI: 
  * If you're using mLab in production, for example, your URI will look like this:
    * e.g.: `mongodb://<username>:<passwword>.mlab.com:<port>/list-project`
  * For now since we're not setting up `mLab` or another `mongodb` service, let's just use our local development URL:
    * e.g.: `mongodb://localhost:27017/list-project`
* JWT_KEY:
  * This is very important and especially important to keep secret. The JWT_KEY is your secret hash that allows you to create new JWTs and unhash existing ones. You can read more about how JWTs work here: https://jwt.io/introduction/
  * You can generate secure JWTs here: https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm
  * It can look something like:
    * `hu0SnUlQBnp2C76jOUpldZfYudYjzBmRAtPLF452Iv0H8n3LaCnYUYXEHYxSKKF`
* MAILER_EMAIL:
  * this is just the email address you want to use to set up your mailing service which will be used to email password confirmations and resets.
  * e.g.: `joeys.list.project@gmail.com`
* MAILER_PASSWORD:
  * this is the password that is associated with the email address given above:
  * e.g.: `my_super_secret_password`
* MAILER_SERVICE:
  * this is the email service that is associated with your email address
  * e.g.: `Gmail`
* MAILER_ADDRESS:
  * this is the address that will be listed on the email sent from your service:
  * e.g.: `Joeys list project <joeys.list.project@gmail.com>`


Now make sure to add these to git:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "adds env variables"
```

## Rest Stop:

At this point we've:
* added all of our environment variables into the `.env` file.

Now that we've set our environment variables in the `.env` file. We can move on to adding our first server code.

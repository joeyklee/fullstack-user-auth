# Step 3: Configure your Config

In this step we're going to take a second to configure our `config.js` file. This will give us some clues to the types of considerations you will need to make with regards to important variables that store things like your server's `IPADDRESS`, the `PORT` number your project is being served on, the `email` address you're using for email validation, etc. 

Let's take a look.

## Adding variables to the config.js file

Add the following code to your `config.js` file:
```js
// requiring dotenv will set all of the .env variables and make them available at process.env.X
require('dotenv').config();
// we use the module.exports pattern to export all of these variables which will then be available as `config.X`
module.exports = {
    PORT: process.env.PORT || 3030,
    JWT_KEY: process.env.JWT_KEY,
    MONGODB_URI: process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/list-project',
    MAILER:{
        EMAIL: process.env.MAILER_EMAIL || 'test@example.com', 
        PASSWORD:process.env.MAILER_PASSWORD || 'secret',
        SERVICE: process.env.MAILER_SERVICE || 'Gmail',
        DEFAULT_ADDRESS: process.env.MAILER_ADDRESS || 'First Last <test@example.com>'
    }
}
```

What is happening here is that we're saying: 
> Here's all these variables we will be using in our project. If we define any of these in our `.env` file, use the given values (e.g. process.env.PORT). If we do not define any variables there, then default to those values given after the `||`. 

Now make sure to add these to git:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "adds config file"
```

## Rest Stop:

At this point we've:
* added all of our configuration values into the `config.js` file.

Now that we've configured our `config.js` file, we can set our environment variables in the `.env` file. This is good practice so that you do not accidentally check in your important credentials that you don't want others to know (e.g. your email address and password etc).

# Step 9: Set up the emailer

Having an emailer set up is an important part of your auth system because it allows you to:
* email people a confirmation that their account has been created.
* email people a temporary token if they forget their password and want to reset it
* confirm with people if they want to delete their account. 
* send notice to your users in case you need to notify them for any reason.

We are going to set up our emailer using the `nodemailer` module. 

For the purpose of this project, set up your `emailer` as a `helper` in the `/helpers` directory. 

Create a file called `emailer.js` in the `/helpers` directory.

In the `emailer.js` file:

```js
const config = require('../config');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const smtpTransport = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: config.MAILER.SERVICE,
  auth: {
    user: config.MAILER.EMAIL,
    pass: config.MAILER.PASSWORD
  }
});

module.exports = smtpTransport;
```

Notice how our nodemailer is going to get the `service`, `user`, and `pass` from our `config` file.

## Add and Commit your changes

```
git add .
git commit -m "adds users emailer"
```

## Rest Stop:

At this point you've:
* created a `emailer` that uses SMTP transport using the nodemailer module that uses in the email service defined in the `.env` and config file.

Before we go on to defining and writing our `user` routes, we are are going to make one more quick stop to create a middleware called `middleware/auth.js` that you will be able to add to any of your routes that will allow you to check if an authentication token has been passed in with the request.

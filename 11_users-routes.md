# Step 9: Defining the Users routes

Here we are going to:
* add the API endpoints that will allow users to signup, login, etc.

This is a roadmap of what we're going to be doing here:

```js
/**
* Step 9.1: read in required modules
**/

/**
* Step 9.2: get user model
**/

/**
* Step 9.3: get user model
**/


// register

// login

// logout

// logout all

// GET /me

// forgot password

// reset_password

```
